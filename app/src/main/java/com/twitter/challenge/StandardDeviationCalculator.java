 * Created by anuj on 3/2/18.
 *
 * Class that has method to calculate standard
 * deviation.
 *
 * Note: I don't think standard deviation calculation by itself
 * merits a class for just one feature/function. Standard deviation
 * can actually be a method in a Utility class (maybe a class called
 * MathUtils).
 * But since there is an existing class for TemperatureConverter,
 * I decided to have a class for Standard Deviation because it is
 * better follow the code style and organization based on existing
 * source code unless there is a compelling reason to refactor the
 * existing code.
